## 1. Introduction of the game SPACE
Welcome to **SPACE**, SPACE is a tablet-based gamified assessment of spatial ability in which participants complete a series of tasks that are known to recruit brain areas (i.e.,hippocampus and entorhinal cortex) affected in patients suffering from dementia. In SPACE, participants take the role of an astronaut who has been sent on a mission to uncover the
potential of a new planet to harbour life. Following an extensive training phase, participants are asked to complete five spatial tasks that are specifically designed to engage different aspects of their navigation ability (i.e., path integration, egocentric pointing, mapping, associative memory, and perspective taking). Individual or aggregated test scores in SPACE will reveal individual differences in spatial ability that may constitute markers of cognitive status that may be used for the early diagnosis of cognitive impairment.

## 2. Log in
To start your adventure, you need to log in to the game:

1. Open the SPACE game application.
2. Enter your username and password.
3. Click the **Log In** button.

If you don't have an account yet, click on **Sign Up** to create a new one.

## 3. Play! Configuration! Movie
### Play
Once logged in, you can start playing:

1. Click on the **Play** button on the main menu.
2. Choose your spaceship and customize your avatar.
3. Start your mission and enjoy the adventure.

### Configuration
#### Configuration Panel – Instructions

This is the panel in which you can set the configuration of the path integration task and decide which landmarks to involve in it. In the configuration panel there are different sections: the **Canvas**, the **Top Panel (TP)**, the **Right Panel (RP)**, the **Left Panel (LP)**, and the **Bottom Panel (BP)**. Each of these parts has its specific functionality.

#### Steps to Configure the Path Integration

1. Activate the Landmarks
- Tap on the icons of the landmarks in the TP you want to activate.
- The activated icons in the TP and the slots of the coordinates will highlight.

2. Position the Landmarks
- **Drag and drop** the activated icons to the desired position on the planet in the Canvas.
- **OR**
- Tap on the activated slots in the RP and type the coordinates.

3. Set the Path Integration
- Drag and drop the activated icons from the TP to the slots in the LP.
- The Power button will show that the trial is not activated if incomplete.

4. Add Trials or Complete Configuration
- Add another trial or press the **Done** button to apply the configuration.
- The lines involving the specific activated trials will turn green to indicate readiness.

#### Error When Activating a Trial

If the canvas lines pass through a landmark area:
- The system will warn you that the configuration is invalid.
- Involved lines turn red.
- The row in the LP is highlighted in red.
- The Power button changes to an Exclamation mark.
- The Done button turns red indicating an error.

#### Solving Errors

To resolve errors, you have three options:

1. **Deactivate the Trial**
   - Tap the Exclamation mark button in the LP to deactivate the trial.
   - The red lines in the canvas will revert to grey.
   
2. **Reposition the Landmark**
   - Drag and drop the icon(s) in the canvas to a new position.
   - Ensure the lines and Done button are not red.
   
3. **Change the Landmark**
   - Drag and drop a new landmark icon from the TP to the LP slot.
   - Ensure the lines and Done button are not red.

#### Order of Administration of Trials

- The order in the LP reflects the administration order.
- You can reorganize the list in the LP by dragging each row.
- Reorganizing may change the orientation of the landmarks and cause errors.

#### Landmarks Orientation

- Default orientation is towards the rocket.
- Orientation changes based on the trial position.
- The orientation remains until the defining trial is deactivated or reordered.

#### Quick Configuration

- **Generate All:** Compiles all possible trials among the activated landmarks.
  - Decide which landmarks to activate and place them on the canvas.
  - Options in the BP:
    - **Randomize:** Generates random trials.
    - **Order:** Organizes trials by the TP order.
    - **First Different:** No two consecutive trials have the same first leg.
- **Activate All:** Quickly activates all listed trials.
#### Randomized Placement

- Set constraints with sliders for distance from the rocket and between landmarks.
- Press **Randomize** to place landmarks according to the constraints.

#### Visualizing Trials in the Canvas

- **Show Activated:** Highlights all active trials in the LP.
- **Hide All:** Hides all lines (green, grey, red) for a clear view or screenshot.

#### Matrices

- **Angles:** Shows angular relation between landmarks.
- **Distances:** Distance between landmarks from spawn point to spawn point.
- **PI Angles:** Rotation needed from the second landmark to the rocket.
- **Path Distances:** Sum of the two legs of the trial, excluding homing.

#### Bottom-Right Panel Functionalities

- **Screenshot:** Takes a screenshot of the canvas.
- **Clear:** Resets the menu.
- **Back:** Returns to the Experimenter menu without saving.
- **Save:** Saves the configuration locally, even if incomplete.
- **Done:** Applies the configuration and returns to the Experimenter menu.
  
#### Final Note

Once satisfied with the settings, press **Done** to apply and save your configuration. If not saved, changes will be lost upon exiting the Experimenter Menu.
